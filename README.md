## Database Schema

### Relationships

- **Users and Games:**
  - There is no direct foreign key relationship between `Users` and `Games` in the current schema. However, each game can be associated with a user via application logic (e.g., a user might start or play a game).

### Users Table

- **id:** INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT
  - The unique identifier for each user. Auto-incremented.
- **username:** TEXT, NOT NULL, UNIQUE
  - The username of the user. Must be unique.
- **password:** TEXT, NOT NULL
  - The hashed password of the user.

### Games Table

- **gameId:** TEXT, PRIMARY KEY
  - The unique identifier for each game.
- **status:** TEXT
  - The status of the game (e.g., "ongoing", "won", "lost").
- **side:** TEXT
  - The side chosen by the user (e.g., "human", "robot").
- **turn:** INTEGER
  - The current turn number in the game.
- **userHealth:** INTEGER
  - The current health of the user.
- **opponentHealth:** INTEGER
  - The current health of the opponent.
- **attackHP:** INTEGER
  - The attack power used in the most recent move.
- **totalAttack:** INTEGER, DEFAULT 0
  - The total attack power accumulated over the course of the game. Defaults to 0.

### Schema Notes

- **Users Table:**

  - The `id` column is an auto-incrementing primary key that uniquely identifies each user.
  - The `username` column is unique and required.
  - The `password` column stores the user's hashed password.

- **Games Table:**

  - The `gameId` serves as a unique identifier for each game session.
  - The `status` column indicates the current state of the game.
  - The `side` column tracks whether the player is on the "human" or "robot" side.
  - The `turn` column keeps track of the current turn in the game.
  - The `userHealth` and `opponentHealth` columns track the health status of the user and the opponent, respectively.
  - The `attackHP` column records the attack power used in the last move.
  - The `totalAttack` column accumulates the total attack power across the game.

- **Normalization:**  
  The schema is designed to be simple and normalized for the purposes of this game. Future extensions might include additional tables or fields to better track user-game relationships, such as adding a foreign key to link users to games they start or participate in.

- **Indexes:**  
  Indexes on `username` in the `Users` table and `gameId` in the `Games` table help improve query performance.

- **Security Considerations:**  
  Passwords are stored hashed, which is crucial for maintaining user security.
